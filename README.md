-------------------

Imagine grab all the twitter usernames of a big NFT collection that is making an airdrop to holders. Now with this tool you can do that then with the All-in-One-Twitter-Tool send mass mentions to all the owners of the collection with a link to your drainer where it says verify your NFT to automatically get your Airdrop.

You would get many NFTs from that collection since victim need to sigh drainer with wallet that have the actual big collection NFT ðŸ¤‘
